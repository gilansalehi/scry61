Hello!  And welcome to Scry61.

Scry61 is an app for Magic: The Gathering enthusiasts that allows users to search
a comprehensive database of Magic cards by applying filters, sorts, and search queries.
Use the query pane on the left to filter the cards; search results are displayed in the
center pane.  Search results can be added to a deck list in the right-hand pane of the App.

Happy gathering!

Features coming soon:
- Sideboard for deck pane.
- Additional filters for Artist, Flavor Text, and Set.
- Advanced filters for card type and text (e.g. 'AND', 'OR', 'NOT' etc.)
- Ability to download decklists in text format.

Feel free to report bugs and request features to gilansalehi@gmail.com.
